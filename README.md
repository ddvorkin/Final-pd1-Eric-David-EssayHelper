Final-pd1-Eric-David-EssayHelper
================================

Final Project

Group Members:
Eric Cheang
David Dvorkin

Instructions for use:

<h2> To use, navigate to the directory dist and use...

<h1>java -jar EssayHelper.jar</h1>

and follow the prompts.

</h2>

<del>Because NetBeans was used for this project (Eclipse doesn't work on my laptop) and because it is not a finished project you must compile each "application" manually by compiling the java files found in FinalProject/EssayHelper/src with the classpath of jsoup inside of the src folder.</del>

Front end is now the terminal. While not optimal, as while writing an essay, you wouldn't want the terminal open, it is what was available with my current resources.

Terminal also raises a variety of problems in terms of intended functionality. 

What works:
A dictionary that allows you to search words from Macmillian Dictionary.
<del>A thesaurus that allows you to search words from Macmillian Thesaurus.</del>
Thesurus is spitting out a lot of garbage HTML code. Would have been fine with HTML as the front end interface, as undefined things in HTML/CSS/JS would not affect functionality or readablity, terminal usage is affected. 

An HTML page that does not work with the actual project.

What doesn't work:
Planner does not work.
HTML Page interactivity with java files.
Other ideas I had for helping with homework like calculator, reverse dictionary, etc.

Structures and Highlights:
Dictionary and <del>thesaurus</del> works in a scummy but simple way.
Planner's "This term data structure" does not work yet.
HTML looks nice, learned a bit of CSS.
