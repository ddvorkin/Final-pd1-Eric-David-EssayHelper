================================

Final Project

Group Members:
Eric Cheang
David Dvorkin

Instructions for use:
Because NetBeans was used for this project (Eclipse doesn't work on my laptop) and because it is not a finished project you must compile each "application" manually by compiling the java files found in FinalProject/EssayHelper/src with the classpath of jsoup inside of the src folder.

What works:
A dictionary that allows you to search words from Macmillian Dictionary.
A thesaurus that allows you to search words from Macmillian Thesaurus.
An HTML page that does not work with the actual project.

What doesn't work:
Planner does not work.
HTML Page interactivity with java files.
Other ideas I had for helping with homework like calculator, reverse dictionary, etc.

Structures and Highlights:
Dictionary and thesaurus works in a scummy but simple way.
Planner's "This term data structure" does not work yet.
HTML looks nice, learned a bit of CSS.
