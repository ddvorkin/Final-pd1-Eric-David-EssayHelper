5/25: Trying out neat knicknacks.

Tried to work with Aloha HTML5 WYSIWYG editor. 
Used an ArrayList to store the information parsed from the Oxford Dictionaries. 
Begins the first steps of ifization, allowing US to parse through the HTML.

5/26: No idea, GitHub was acting weird.

Probably some more stuff with ifization.
Created a new branch, which decimated the functionality of GitHub for me.

5/27: Testing the arrayList functionality.

Conducted a bunch of print lines to figure out where to parse.
Parsed and put things inside of the HTML. 
First print, but riddled with bugs. 

6/3: Attempts at making an html page.

6/4: Instead of an arrayList, I began looking into a linked list to store the information.

6/6: Finished the great ification. There are major problems where the head node is replaced because we record phrases after sentences.
