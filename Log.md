5/25: Trying out neat knicknacks.

Tried to work with Aloha HTML5 WYSIWYG editor.

5/26: No idea, GitHub was acting weird.

Probably some more stuff with ifization.
Created a new branch, which decimated the functionality of GitHub for me.

Conducted a bunch of print lines to figure out where to parse.
Parsed and put things inside of the HTML. 
First print, but riddled with bugs.

6/4: Instead of an arrayList, I began looking into a linked list to store the information.

6/6: Finished the great ification. There are major problems where the head node is replaced because we record phrases after sentences.

6/10: Commit yesterday's changes.

Added Tokenizer to parse through HTML, eventually getting the DICTIONARY TO WORK! Aftwerwards, parsed final string to be returned up, through trimming and substringing out garbage test. Oh joyous days.

6/10 Attempted to place .jar file in folder - failed. Switching to work with netbeans. Made for loop and helped with more definitions.

6/11: Continued to spruce up final returned string to accomodate and present multiple definitions. Also fixed the code to allow for multi-word (phrased) definitions. Ex. Searching up the word "home page" or "drag queen".

Also cleaned out some code.

6/12: Integration
Began looking into how I can integrate Dictionary to a user without the terminal. Looked into HTML, and thus, javascript.

6/13: Thesaurus
Finished Thesaurus in its entirety, as I just compied from Dictionary and changed the website and a few changes to parsing. Fixed up thesaurus presentation. 

Also created a new branch to work in html with, despite not knowing how to use branches. This comes back to haunt me. 

6/13 Trying different things from online to get html to work with Dictionary. Encountering difficulties; nothing yet.

FIXING BRANCHES SORRY

6/14: HTML full time
Picked up a nifty HTML template. Played around with that, making a snazzy front page webpage and set up a free server. 

Fixed the branch I made the day before. This causes a large amount of commits of nothing but deleting and recloning.

6/15: Accents

Created an accents application to allow spanish essay writers copy and paste accented letters without memorizing keystrokes for certain letters.

Worked with HTML and thus CSS. Was not fun. Tried to figure out a way to implement HTML and java together. 

Did not work.

6/17: Ded

Because of the focus of making things pretty, forgot to include something we learned this year. Got on a planner project to utilize stacks and queues. Could not finish, but I do have a sense of time for tasks. 

Additionally, fixed up the log.
